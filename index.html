<h2>HTML</h2>

  <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It consists of a series of elements represented by tags that define the content and layout of a webpage. These elements include headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more, allowing developers to build structured documents that can be rendered by web browsers. HTML works in conjunction with other technologies like CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing web experiences.</p>


<h2>CSS</h2>
  
  <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and design of HTML documents. It allows developers to define styles for elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and layout, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing look across different web pages. CSS can be applied inline, internally within an HTML document, or externally via a separate stylesheet. By separating content from design, CSS enhances maintainability and enables responsive web design techniques that adapt layouts to various screen sizes and devices.</p>
